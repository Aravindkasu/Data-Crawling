# Data-Crawling
Extracting2020 archive URLs of a specific target based on the results of "commoncrawl.org". 
In Commoncrawl, Indexes are available with URLs. These are stored in json file called callinfo.json
It contains data with ID,description and location.
I have filtered the Index ID which contains 2020 data in it as a result I have extracted archive urls of 2020.
Using that api's I have tried to extract the url's related to covid domain.
